# IP3â€”three words for any IPv4 address

This tool can calculate three word triplets for any IPv4 address from a list of about two thousand English words.  
For example, `google.com` (`172.217.16.238`) is `manned-softer-for`, `rocky-lusty-voice`, and `leash-larval-racing`.

This is a toy with myriad issues: reverse DNS lookup is harder than it should be, HTTPS isn't designed to work well with bare IP addresses, IPv4 will eventually be deprecated, and the fundamental problems with What3Words apply here also.

Imagine how much lower the barrier to entry for the web would be if bare IP addresses, or cryptographic addresses for each author, were made more accessible (or just *accessible*).

Furthermore, the vast majority of our progeny will be among the stars&mdash;what will the web look like then?
